# MuseumCurator

The aim of this project is to improve the work-life balance of museum curators through UI Path's RPA tools. The processes being automated are:

1. Use email extraction to log data regarding artefacts/paintings (depending on type of museum)
2. Send automated emails for lack of responses
3. Auto generate descriptions through provided data using ChatGPT's API
